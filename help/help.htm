<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Cryptographp_XH is based on cryptographp. Many thanks to Sylvain Brison for making this nice and quite flexible CAPTCHA available under a GPL compatible license. The audio CAPTCHA was inspired by braillecaptcha by <em>johnjdoe</em>, and made possible by the phantastic <a href="https://www.theblog.ca/mp3-audio-files-alphabet">MP3 files</a> from Peter Keung, which have been released as freeware.</p>
<p>The plugin logo is designed by <a href="https://store.kde.org/u/InFeRnODeMoN">Pavel InFeRnODeMoN</a>. Many thanks for releasing this icon under GPL.</p>
<p>The icons used in the front-end are designed by <a href="https://material.io/icons/">Google</a>. Many thanks for releasing the icons under Apache License Version 2.0.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the community at the <a href="https://www.cmsimpleforum.com/">CMSimple_XH Forum</a> for tips, suggestions and testing. Particulary I want to thank <em>snafu</em>, who pointed me to cryptographp, and <em>oldnema</em>, who contributed the first set of language files for the audio CAPTCHA.</p>
<p>And last but not least many thanks to <a href="https://www.harteg.dk/">Peter Harteg</a>, the “father” of CMSimple, and all developers of <a href="https://www.cmsimple-xh.org">CMSimple_XH</a> without whom this amazing CMS would not exist.</p>
